### Overview

Feel free to change any part of the existing implementation that your like. 
It currently implemented just enough to satisfy the test scenarios that have been laid out. 
This is not intended to be an all encompassing solution. Add as many other classes and test as you like. 
Corrections should be suggested for the following circumstances:

### Part I - Ownership by a proper single noun

* Proper nouns suffixed with "s", followed by a noun, need an apostrophe before the "s".
* Proper nouns suffixed with "s", preceded by "is", need an apostrophe before the "s".

NOTE: There are fully implemented unit tests for these scenarios. You just need to make them pass.

### Part II - Contractions

* isnt, wont, and doesnt need apostrophes

NOTE: There are no unit preexisting unit tests for this part. Please author these tests as you see fit.

### Part III - Regular nouns do not need apostrophes

* common mistakes recognition

NOTE: There are fully implemented unit tests for these scenarios. You just need to make them pass.

### Summary

Your goal is to implement the "CorrectionFinder" class to accomodate the logic described above.
